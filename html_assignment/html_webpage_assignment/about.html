        <h2>About FrontEnd Technology</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">Front-end technology is a crucial part of web development that
          focuses on building the visual and interactive parts of websites and
          web applications â€” the parts users see and interact with directly in
          their browser. It is built on three core languages: HTML (HyperText
          Markup Language) for creating the structure of web pages, CSS
          (Cascading Style Sheets) for designing and styling the content, and
          JavaScript for adding interactive features like dropdowns, sliders,
          and form validations. In modern development, front-end engineers also
          use advanced JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as React,
          Angular, and Vue.js to build faster, scalable, and more efficient
          applications. These tools help in creating Single Page Applications
          (SPAs) and enable real-time updates without refreshing the page.
        </p>
          <p class="aboutPara">
          Additionally, developers use responsive design techniques and CSS
          frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS to make websites work well
          on various screen sizes and devices. Version control systems like Git,
          build tools like Webpack, and package managers such as npm or yarn are
          also commonly used to manage and streamline front-end development.
          With the growing importance of user experience (UX) and performance,
          front-end development continues to evolve, requiring developers to
          keep learning and adapting to new tools, trends, and best
          practices.
